* script to allow for picking up of physics objects (source-engine style) -- largely done
* script to allow for interacting with in-world buttons (which will then need scripts to determine what they do) -- done - see toggleablelight
* model an environment/building to explore in blender -- needs attention
* game design/writing/themes -- needs work (hard to write new features without a goal in mind)

Game idea:

A vaporwave themed puzzle/horror game, with minimal plot beyond the experience itself, designed to somewhat emulate the barrenness of environments found in early computer graphics (example: myst)

focus on exploration, and doesnt force the player to play at any particular pace

i think the spooky statuetka is pretty neato
* weeping angel mechanics, but is much freakier as an abstract statue
  - where the horror element might come in
